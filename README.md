Hello!

Welcome to my website. This site was built using Jekyll and Node and deployed to AWS Amplify. The README for the Jekyll theme and the Amplify build settings can be found in the reference_docs folder.

This site is built using the default Ruby and Node versions specified in the base Docker image used by Amplify. Specifically, it uses Ruby 2.4.6 and Node 10.16.0.
