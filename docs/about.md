# About Me
My name is Robert Allen. I am a Boston-based IT professional, with broad experiences from local desktop environments to cloud applications.

In my free time, I enjoy dreaming up ideas, cooking in the kitchen and my two cats, Rollo and Ruby. One day, I hope to publish some video games.

My favorite popcorn classics are:
- Lord of the Rings: Extended Editions
- Manhunter (1986) 
- Mad Max (2015)
